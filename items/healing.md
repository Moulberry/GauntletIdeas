# Healing Items

## Mechanic: Healing Sickness
Healing sickness prevents the use of MOST healing items.
If you are not in combat, healing sickness lasts only 5 seconds.
If you are in combat, healing sickness lasts until the end of combat.

This makes stronger healing items more powerful than spamming lots of
lesser healing items
