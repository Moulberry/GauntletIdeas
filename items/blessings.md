# Blessings?

**Note: Not sure if "blessings" as items makes sense...**
**These are kind of like the playing cards from isaac**
**Maybe, like the playing cards, you can only hold one blessing at once?**
**These items don't necessarily need descriptions. The players should**
**maybe figure out how they work on their own. Especially since some**
**of the effects are complicated**

**Note 2: None of these work in boss room**

**Also Note: I know some of these effects are super busted. eg.
aether, that may let you break certain rooms. This is fine. Let
players have fun**
